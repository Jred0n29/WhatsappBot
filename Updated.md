## Whatsapp Bot For Managing Expenses
Create a WhatsApp Bot: WhatsApp provides APIs through its WhatsApp Business API which can be used to create a bot. 
WhatsApp has some restrictions on automated messages, so make sure to comply with their policies.

* Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Expense Tracking:
You will need to use some basic NLP to parse your messages and extract the relevant information (amount and purpose of expense). 
This can be done using libraries like NLTK or Spacy in Python, or you could also build a basic parser yourself if your messages follow a very consistent format.


* Manage Data in a Spreadsheet:
For this, you can use Google Sheets API or Excel's equivalent (Microsoft Graph). 
This will allow you to write your data into a spreadsheet programmatically.


* Automate Monthly Reporting: 
You can write a script that will be scheduled to run at the end of every month to generate the report. 
This script will use the spreadsheet API to pull your expense data and generate the report, then send it to you on WhatsApp.
